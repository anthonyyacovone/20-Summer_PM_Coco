<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What is this study about?</u></strong></h2>
This study using a method called "phoneme monitoring." A phoneme is the smallest unit of meaningful sound in a word (e.g. a single sound like /t/). We are asking participants to try and "monitor" for upcoming sounds to see 
  how successful they are throughout the story.<br><br>
As we listen to someone tell us a story, we can occassionally guess or finish the person's sentence in our mind before they say anything.<br><br>
  <ul><li>For example: If I said, "I like my coffee with cream and..." you could probably guess that I was about to say "sugar"</li>
      <li>We are interested in whether people hit Space bar earlier and more often in predictable vs. less predictable sentences</li></ul>

<hr>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>How did we do this?</u></strong></h2>
We had a native English speaker read a children's storybook aloud. We then found the T-words in very predictable (e.g. the case of the <b style = "color:red;"><u>T</u>URTLE</b> snatcher) and less predictable
 sentences(e.g. "She wanted <b style = "color:red;"><u>T</u>O</b> invite all of the boys in the class <b style = "color:red;"><u>T</u>OO</b>).<br><br>
 
<b>We were interested in a few things:</b>
<li>Were you able to press Space BEFORE even hearing a T-word because you predicted it?<br></li>
<li>Were you faster to hit Space in predictable sentences relative to less predictable sentences?<br></li>
<li>Were you more likely to notice the T-words in predictable sentences vs. those in unpredictable sentences?</li><br><br>
  
<hr>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>Why should we do this study?</u></strong></h2>
We hope this task will provide information about how people attend to stories. Most language research involves listening to individual sentences that do not create a larger story (e.g. "The cat is fluffy" then "The chef cooked lobster last night"). 
    We believe that listeners are better at anticipating what someone will say when they are listening to an interesting story. This type of "linguistic mind-reading" is what we are primarily interested in understanding.<br><br>
